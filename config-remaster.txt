The Lithium remaster port doesn't have all of the features of the original
and probably won't ever have them all; I've mostly left out features that
have to do with server administration, map management, and hud/GUI. You can
compare this file to config-original.txt to see what's missing.

The top half of this text file contains settings that can be configured in
the rerelease. Some are remaster specific ex. expansion weapons. The bottom
half contains settings that aren't available in the remaster and some
justification as to why they're aren't implemented (the reason is mostly I'm
either lazy or don't see enough value in adding it).

Also note that a few settings start with g_, I've mostly stuck with this to
denote it is a major feature (basically hooks/rune related):
use_runes -> g_use_runes
use_hook -> g_use_hook

rune_flags         determines which runes will show in the game, add these:

Settings in the original not added to remaster:
===============================================================================
Administration stuff:

HUD, misc gameplay, and more admin settings:

Ammo and Armor settings:
- dropweapammo is interesting, players don't need to make binds to drop ammo
together with weapons but I think I'd rather implement an alternate drop command
to drop ammo instead
- armorinfo is made constant for some reason, it's probably fine to make it a
regular variable but not going to for now
- max_armor seems janky - appears to only affect shards

dropweapammo       percentage of default ammo gained from a dropped weapon

max_armor

jacket_armor       sets pickup amount, max amount, normal resist, energy resist
combat_armor       sets pickup amount, max amount, normal resist, energy resist
